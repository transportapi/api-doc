    The Places endpoint is in alpha testing, and may be subject to change

    Places are a generic name for various types of geo-located search results which can be retrieved via this single
    flexible API endpoint. This includes transport stop points for bus, train, tube etc. as well as non-transport
    related results such as postcodes and names of towns/villages/streets and points of interest.

        Query text for performing a text matching search. Search results will include 'fuzzy' matches for similar
        spellings. The query text can be arbitrary input from the user (perhaps from a search box). Use standard
        [URL encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding)
      example: wembley

          $ref: '../parameters/places.yaml#/placeType'
      description: |
        A set of types to limit the search results to. The default is to match on all types. The set of possible match
        types are currently as follows:
          * `train_station` - A search within our transport data for the name of the train station
          * `bus_stop` - A search within our transport data for the name of bus stop station (These are often named
            after streets/towns and so will match many search queries)
          * `tram_stop` - A search within our transport data for the name of the tram stop
          * `tube_station` - A search within our transport data for the name of the tube station
          * `settlement` - Map data geocoding match for a city/town/village/suburb/neighbourhood
          * `street` - Map data geocoding match for a street (Note this can result in some postcode matches for known
            streets within postcodes)
          * `poi` - Map data geocoding match for a point of interest. Th is intended to be limited to significant
            places of interest (POIs) which are more likely to be a regular destination used by tourists for example
          * `postcode` - A postcode lookup. Currently this will only match a full UK postcode, but works with any
            spacing or case

        We may add new search match types in future and these would likely be included by default (when we return all
        types)

                        A longer textual description providing extended information (extension of the name). When
                        present, this may be supplying important context or identifying detail which may be required by
                        a user to make sense of a search result. For example you might find several settlements with
                        the same name, but the descriptions will tell us which part of the country each of the search
                        results are in

                        source used for that type). For wide area places such as settlements these coordinates will be
                        placed centrally

                        The OpenStreetMap element type ('node'/'way'/'relation') followed by a colon ':' char followed
                        by the OpenStreetMap numeric id if the object. This is enough to uniquely reference an object
                        within OpenStreetMap's database. Note that cross-referencing with the OSM database in this way
                        will always come with a (usually small) risk that the OSM database ids have changed. We return
                        this field only for matches coming directly from OpenStreetMap data (settlements, streets, and
                        places of interest). We don't currently return OSM ids for other place types such as train
                        stations
